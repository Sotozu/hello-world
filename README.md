# hello-world

Hi all!
My name is Alexander Soto and I am aiming to start a career in video games. Though I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Business Management I want to apply my major to the video game industry. Currently I am also pursuing a Minor in Computer Science. I am ready to put in the effort and start my official journey in coding. I want to be able to interact with others who know the more technical side of video gaming by speaking their language..*cough* code duh. Looking forward to working with others!
